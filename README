SMArt Sample Apps
Joshua dot Mandel at childrens.harvard.edu

This repository contains a collection of sample SMArt Connect Apps:
 
 * API Playground 
 * Got Statins
 * Med List
 * Problem List
 * Blue Button Import (+ Med Coder to clean up imported data)

The entire collection of sample apps is packaged here as a django app,
because that's how we deploy it on our development servers.  All the
javascript/html code resides in /static.

Most of these apps were built using the JavascriptMVC framework.
There's a shared library of data models and common code in
static/framework/smart, and individual application code resides in
subdirectories of static/framework
(e.g. static/framework/problem_list).
