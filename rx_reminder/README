A sample SMArt REST App that gets a medication list and displays when
each prescription fulfillment will run out.

You can run this app inside the reference container by running it
locally on port 8000.  You'll need the following python packages:
web.py, rdflib, rdflibextras, and pyparsing.

To get started on ubuntu, you can
  apt-get install git-core python-webpy python-pyparsing python-setuptools
  easy_install -U "rdflib>=3.0.0" rdfextras

To get started on Windows, you can:
  * Install python 2.7: http://www.python.org/getit/
  * Install git: http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/
  * Install setuptools:  http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py (download + run)
  * c:\pythonxx\Scripts\easy_install.exe web.py pyparsing rdflib rdfextras

Now. obtain and launch reminder.py:
  git clone https://github.com/chb/smart_rx_reminder.git
  cd smart_rx_reminder
  python reminder.py 8000

patient, and doing some very simple processing.
